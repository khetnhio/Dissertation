This code is part of my Dissertation "Multimodal Deep Learning for Pneumonia Detection:
Development and Analysis" for the University of Surrey

The notebooks seen here were used to develop the Multimodal model.
At the begining of each notebook an overview is provided detailing 
what the role of each one is as part of the whole project.
